# Abstract

In this talk you learn how to make standard regulatory tables and table
shells for clinical research using the {gtreg} package in R. This includes: 
adverse event tables, summary tables with multi-line statistics for continuous variables,
and raw data listings tables with grouped data. Table elements like headers, 
footers, or captions are customizable using {gtreg} column selectors, and the 
{gt} package can be used to implement final styling tweaks on your table. Lastly, 
{gtreg} tables are easily output to various formats, including HTML, PDF, RTF, Word, and Excel.
